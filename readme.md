# ðŸ¦š React Depree

An idea to write "side-effect free" react components, enabling clean dependency injection on every level of the components tree!

The package exposes a provider component and a hook, thats all, with these 2 constructs you can write every function component / hook without directly polluting them with side-effects!

## Previous art

The idea comes from [react-magnetic-di](https://github.com/albertogasparin/react-magnetic-di) by [Alberto Gasparin](https://github.com/albertogasparin).
